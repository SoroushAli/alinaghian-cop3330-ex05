Example Output

What is the first number? 10

Constraints

Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that you convert these values to numbers before doing the math.
Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical conversions and other processing.
Generate a single output statement with line breaks in the appropriate spots.

Challenges

Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Don’t allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
Don’t allow the user to enter a negative number.
Break the program into functions that do the computations.
Implement this program as a GUI program that automatically updates the values when any value changes.
